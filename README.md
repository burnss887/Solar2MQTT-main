# How to use:
- flash your ESP8266 (recommended Wemos D1 Mini) with our [Flash2MQTT-Tool](https://all-solutions.github.io/Flash2MQTT/?get=Solar2MQTT) or with [Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer/releases)
- connect the ESP like the [wiring diagram](https://github.com/softwarecrash/Solar2MQTT/wiki/Wiring-Diagram)
- search for the wifi ap "Solar2MQTT-AP" and connect to it
- surf to 192.168.4.1 and set up your wifi and optional MQTT

- MAX3232 module Like this https://amzn.eu/d/8t3gk5t or https://bit.ly/3BFPqrw or with orginal cable https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09XWPTDYP
- DC-DC buck module - 12-80v down to 5v

# Completely assembled and tested PCB's

You are welcome to get fully stocked and tested PCB's. These are then already loaded with the lastest firmware. The earnings from the PCBs are used for the further development of existing and new projects.
